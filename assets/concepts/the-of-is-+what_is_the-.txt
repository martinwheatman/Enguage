# Induction:
On "the FUNCTION of AND-LIST-PARAMS is EXPR-BODY":
	#set the PARAMS of FUNCTION to BODY;
	perform "function create FUNCTION PARAMS / BODY";
	then, reply "ok, the FUNCTION of PARAMS is BODY".

On "the value of VARIABLE is PHRASE-VALUE", set VARIABLE to VALUE.

On "the ATTR of ENT is PHRASE-VALUE":
	perform "value set ENT ATTR VALUE";
	then, reply "ok, the ATTR of ENT is VALUE".

# the height of an entity is a numeric variable.
# the factorial of n is n times the factorial of n minus 1.
# the factorial of 1 is 1.
# the sum of x and y is x plus y


# Deduction:
# what is the height of martin.

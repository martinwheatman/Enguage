# Induction:
On "the FUNCTION of AND-LIST-PARAMS is PHRASE-BODY":
	#set the PARAMS of FUNCTION to BODY;
	perform "function create FUNCTION PARAMS / BODY";
	then, reply "ok".

On "the value of VARIABLE is PHRASE-VALUE", set VARIABLE to VALUE.

# the height of an entity is a numeric variable.
# the factorial of n is n times the factorial of n minus 1.
# the factorial of 1 is 1.
# the sum of x and y is x plus y


# Deduction:
# what is the height of martin.
#On "what is the ATTR of ENTITY", get the ATTR of ENTITY.

On "what is the FUNCTION of AND-LIST-PARAMS":
	perform "function evaluate FUNCTION PARAMS";
	if not, get the FUNCTION of PARAMS;
	if not, reply "I do not know";
	then, reply "the FUNCTION of PARAMS is ...".

#On "what is the value of VARIABLE":
#	perform "variable get VARIABLE";
#	then, reply "..., the value of VARIABLE is ...".
	
On "what is the value of VARIABLE":
	get the value of VARIABLE;

# the height of an entity is a numeric variable.
# the factorial of n is n times the factorial of n minus 1.
# the factorial of 1 is 1.
# the sum of x and y is x plus y

# 	perform "function create FUNCTION ( PARAMS ) BODY";
#	then, reply "deduction ok".

# the height of martin is 194.
# (what is the factorial of 4).

# Enguage - Unifying Speech and Computation

Enguage is an engine for creating language: a virtual machine for voice.

The [basic principle](doc/principle.md) is that it uses speech utterances to 
create speech utterances. Utterances are used to elevate speech as thoughts and
references: "to the phrase hello reply hello to you too". Thoughts reference a 
reply ('the factorial of one is one'); references reference futher utterances
(the factorial of n is n times the factorial of n minus one').

This is different to the imperative model used by smart speaker devices 
('play this', 'buy that') where actions are provided by written program,
in particular JavaScript, typically on a web server. Source code can't create 
(and upload and publish) source code.

Using thoughts means that the instruction of a machine is generated by voice 
*at the point of use*.
You directly interact with your machine:
there’s no pesky JavaScript or corporate websites to get in the way!

The most complete is need+needs.txt, but other examples include
meeting.txt which is both a temporal and a spatial concept.

If you don’t like it, tell me; if you, do tell others!

# Enguage - Unifying Speech and Computation
<p>Enguage is a natural language engine: a virtual machine for voice.

The [basic principle](doc/principle.md) is that it uses human social interaction as a model for human computer interaction,
by using thoughts to interpret utterances to obtain a reply.
This is different to the simple imperative model used by smart speaker
devices ('play this', 'buy that') because thoughts are also given as utterances.
This means machine instruction -- the construction fo thoughts -- can be generated by voice —
you can directly interact with the machine:
there’s no pesky JavaScript or corporate websites to get in the way!</p>

<P>For further examples of repertoires, see the etc/ directory.
The most complete is need+needs.txt, but other examples include
meeting.txt which is both a temporal and a spatial concept.
The output from the test you’ve already run is produced from the
repertoires in the assets directory—search through this for examples o
f how you can say/code things. If a variable has PHRASE- in front of it
it will match more than one word. If it has NUMERIC- it will match an
apparent number (this, I’m afraid is English based for the moment,
e.g. ‘a’ = 1, sorry!)

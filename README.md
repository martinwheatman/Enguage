# Enguage - Unifying Speech and Computation

Enguage is a Turing Complete speech interpreter;
you *can* do things with words.
Speech is not just functional, it can be deterministic.
This is the approach taken by the [Ordinary Language Philosophers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ordinary_language_philosophy) of the mid- to late-20th Century.

The [basic principle](doc/principle.md) is that it uses speech utterances to create speech utterances.
Utterances are used to elevate speech as thoughts; in this sense, it is autopoietic, such as, "to the phrase hello reply hello to you too".
Thoughts, in turn, reference a reply, such as, "the factorial of one is one".
Using very simple pattern matching techniques, thoughts can be expanded to open repertoire, such as
"the factorial of n is n times the factorial of n minus one".
In this way, a system of speech can simulate a Turing machine.

This is different to the imperative model used by smart speaker devices 
('play this', 'buy that') where actions are provided by written program,
in particular JavaScript, typically on a web server.
Source code can't create (and upload and publish) source code.

This is also different to the probabilistic generative text AI where the 'algorithm' is opaque.

Using thoughts means that the instruction of a machine is generated by voice *at the point of use*.
You directly interact with your machine:
there’s no pesky JavaScript nor corporate websites (nor killer robots!) to get in the way!

The most complete is need+needs.txt, but other examples include
meeting.txt which is both a temporal and a spatial concept.

If you don’t like it, tell me; if you, do tell others!

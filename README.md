# Enguage - Unifying Speech and Computation

Enguage is a Turing Complete speech interpreter;
you can _do_ things with words.

[Installation Instructions](doc/install.md)

Enguage interprets speech much like functional programming language.
It is neither a chatbot, nor a generative text algorithm: it expresses the arbitrary transformation of utterances,
in the same way as computation is the description of an arbitrary calculation in Turing's Universal Machine.
In doing this, it takes inspiration from the 
[Ordinary Language Philosophers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ordinary_language_philosophy)
who removed the underlying representation in logic:
the *received wisdom* of a dualistic representation of meaning 
such as how the meaning of source code being found in machine code.

[Applying this Philosophy](doc/philosophy.md)

[The Prinicples of Enguage](doc/principles.md)

As an example, the
[factorial function](etc/rpts/maths/the-of-is-%2Bwhat_is_the-.txt)
is created , thus:
* the factorial of 1 is 1.
* the factorial of n is n times the factorial of n minus 1.

### Play with Enguage:

For further examples of repertoires, see the etc/rpt and etc/dict directory.

The most complete idea is need+needs.txt, but other examples include meeting.txt which is both
a temporal and a spatial concept.

Happy talking!

# Enguage - Unifying Speech and Computation

Enguage is a Turing Complete speech interpreter;
you can _do_ things with words.

[Installation Instructions](doc/install.md)

Enguage interprets speech using speech much like a dictionary.
It is neither a chatbot, nor a generative text algorithm: it presents the arbitrary transformation of utterances, in the same way as computation is the presentation of an arbitrary calculation—a Turning Machine.
However, it takes inspiration from the 
[Ordinary Language Philosophers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ordinary_language_philosophy)
of Ogden and Richards, Austin, and Grice who removed the idea of an underlying logic to language: the *received wisdom* of a dualistic representation of meaning such as source code.

Speech, itself, is shown to be **Turing Complete** (i.e. a 
[computational device](doc/principle.md)).
Think of Turing’s Universal Machine but one which works on large (Gödel) numbers rather than Turing’s High German characters onto binary digits.
This maps a spoken utterance onto the utterances this **implies** (c/f Grice).
Each of these thoughts (or ‘internally spoken utterances’) provides a functional approach to language (c/f Ogden and Richards).
The **felicity** of what is said (c/f Austin) is maintained, encoded into each reply, to providing conditional processing of subsequent thoughts (c/f Turing).
This functional approach is **recursive**, allowing loops to be formed and speech to be Turing Complete.

As an example, the
[factorial function](etc/rpts/maths/the-of-is-%2Bwhat_is_the-.txt)
is created , thus:
+ the factorial of 1 is 1.
+ the factorial of n is n times the factorial of n minus 1.

### Play with Enguage:

For further examples of repertoires, see the etc/rpt and etc/dict directory.

The most complete idea is need+needs.txt, but other examples include meeting.txt which is both
a temporal and a spatial concept.

Happy talking!

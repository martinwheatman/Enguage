# Enguage - Unifying Speech and Computation
<p>Enguage is a natural language engine: a virtual machine for voice.

The [basic principle](doc/principle.md) is that it uses human social 
interaction as a model for human computer interaction, by using thoughts 
to interpret utterances. Thoughts are just unspoken utterances.

This is different to the imperative model used by smart speaker devices 
('play this', 'buy that') because actions are provided by written program,
in particular JavaScript, typically on a web server.

Using thoughts means that the creation of machine instruction - the construction of 
thoughts - can be generated by voice.
You directly interact with your machine:
there’s no pesky JavaScript or corporate websites to get in the way!

<P>For further examples of repertoires, see the etc/ directory.
The most complete is need+needs.txt, but other examples include
meeting.txt which is both a temporal and a spatial concept.
The output from the test you’ve already run is produced from the
repertoires in the assets directory—search through this for examples o
f how you can say/code things. If a variable has PHRASE- in front of it
it will match more than one word. If it has NUMERIC- it will match an
apparent number (this, I’m afraid is English based for the moment,
e.g. ‘a’ = 1, sorry!)
<p>If you don’t like it, tell me; if you, do tell others!
<p>Happy talking!<br/>

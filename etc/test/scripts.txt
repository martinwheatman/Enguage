# This script remains under development!!
#
# Because these tests use the Yagadi.Ltd/bin scripts, and run them via a Process,
# the scripts need to be on the vanilla path, e.g. in (or linked into) ~/bin
#
# If not, some of these will return "sorry , i don't know" etc.
# I've added these in to let the missing scripts not fail the test;
# however, the ones which pass will be saved elsewhere?

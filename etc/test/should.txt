# another null test...

		i don't understand , wearing a mask prevents the spread of covid.


# Ok, now construct an argument:
i can say wearing a mask prevents the spread of covid because a mask soaks up moisture from your breath:
		ok , you can say wearing a mask prevents the spread of covid because a mask soaks up moisture from my breath.


# Use these to test the argument...

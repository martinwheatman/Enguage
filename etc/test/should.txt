# Build a simple approach to 'should':
# ctor: what should we do
to the phrase what should we do reply we should whatever.
this implies that you get the value of should.
then if not reply i don't know what we should do.
			
# c'tor: you should ...
to the phrase you should phrase variable action reply ok variable action.
this implies that you set the value of should to variable action.

# Null test...
what should we do: i don't know what we should do.

# Construct an argument:
# wearing a mask prevents (or not?) the spread of covid...
you can say wearing a mask prevents the spread of covid.
you can say wearing a mask does not prevent the spread of covid.

# masks soak up (or not?) moisture from your breath
you can say a mask soaks up moisture from your breath.
you can say a mask does not soak up moisture from your breath.

## the problem is here:
## does a mask soak moisture from your breath (to any great extent?)

# Use these to test the argument...
wearing a mask prevents the spread of covid because a mask soaks up moisture from your breath:
			     ok , wearing a mask prevents the spread of covid because a mask soaks up moisture from my breath.
you should wear a mask because wearing a mask prevents the spread of covid:
				 ok , i should wear a mask because wearing a mask prevents the spread of covid.

# We can now conclude...
what should we do: we should wear a mask.

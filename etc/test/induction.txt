#TODO: create filename from pattern:
#   i need phrase variable objects => i_need-.txt (append? create overlay)
#   this is part of the need concept => need.txt (append)
#   Enguage.interpret() => overlay
#   Conceept.load() => can this outlive Enguage overlay???
#
#
# The first portion of induction was interfering with
# name.entry in /etc/dictn/name.entry
##...or to put it another way
interpret i am called something like this:  ok.
Where that something is a variable.
this implies that name is set to something: ok, name is set to something.
then if so reply i already knew this:       ok, if so , reply i already knew this.
then set name to something:                 ok, set  name to something.
then reply hi something:                    ok, reply hi something.

i am called martin: hi martin.

# ...means.../...the means to...
# 1. from the-means-to repertoire
to the phrase phrase variable x the means to phrase variable y reply i really do not understand: ok.
			
do we have the means to become rich: I really don't understand.

# 2. could this be built thus?
to the phrase phrase variable this means phrase variable someth reply ok: ok.
this implies that you perform sign create that this:  ok, perform sign create that this.
this implies that you perform sign think that someth:   ok, perform sign think that someth.

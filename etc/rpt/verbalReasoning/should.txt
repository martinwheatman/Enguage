## Build a simple approach to 'should':
## ctor: what should we do

#to the phrase what should we do reply we should whatever: ok.
#this implies that you get the value of should           : ok.
#then if not reply i don't know what we should do        : ok.
#save this idea as should                                : ok.

On "what should we do":
	get the value of should;
	if not, reply "i don't know what we should do";
	reply we should ... .

## c'tor: you should ...
#to the phrase you should phrase variable action reply ok variable action.
#this implies that you set the value of should to variable action.

On "you should PHRASE-ACTION":
	set the value of should to ACTION;
	reply "ok, ACTION".

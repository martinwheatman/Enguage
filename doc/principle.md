# Enguage - Basic Principles

Enguage attempts to reflect the conventional mapping of words uttered
to those replied.
This convention is based on the idea that we think in utterances,
and it is directed by our reaction to those thoughts.

utterance --> {thoughts} --> {replies} </br>
------ felicity ------->

## Utterance
Thoughts and replies are just utterances. An utterance is just any string 
of words, there is no need for it to conform to any syntax - this is 
arbtrary mapping.

## Thought
Thoughts are unspoken utterances, used to interpret utterances, and are 
interpreted themsleves.

## Reply
A reply is a formatted answer. A different reply (format) will be provided
at each level of interpretation.

### Answer
An answer will be passed up, verbatim, through the interpretation (layers 
of thought.) 

## Felicity
Underlying the interpretation of thoughts is the felicity, or happiness, 
of their reply. If a reply is infelicitous, interpretation proceeds on the 
thoughts that are preceded with "if not, "; felicitous replies can be,
but are not necessarily, prefixed by "if so, ".

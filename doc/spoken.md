# Programming By Voice
You can program repertoires/concepts by copying the examples in
./etc/reps, in a [traditional written file](./written.md);
however, you can also program Enguage by voice:

<pre>> To the phrase hello reply hello to you too.
> hello.
Hello to you too.</pre>

<p>You can introduce simple variables:</p>
<pre>> To the phrase my name is variable name reply hello variable name.
> my name is martin.
hello martin.
</pre>

Simple functions can be programmed by voice:
<pre>The product of x and y is x times y.
> What is the product of 6 and 7.
42, the product of 6 and 7 is 42.
</pre>
This includes recursive functions:
<pre>
> The factorial of n is n times the factorial of n minus 1.
> What is the factorial of 4.
24, the factorial of 4 is 24.
</pre>

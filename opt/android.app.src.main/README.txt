The Enguage Android app was originally developed under Eclipse, and was later 
moved to Android Studio.

To keep the platform independent Enguage src and Android code together, the
specific files are kept up to date here.  However, if we store Java files here,
Eclipse will need to see them as buildable, and demand android libs are 
available.  So .java files are saved as .jav.
